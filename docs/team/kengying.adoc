=== Enhancement Added: `Group`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=adding-a-person-code-add-code]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

User will be able to add group to their different clients. The difference between `tag` and `group` is that, a user must have a group when being added while tag is optional.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=group]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: `List`

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=listing-all-persons-code-list-code]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

As the amount of contacts increase, there will be too many tags and groups to keep track. `List` tags/groups, will be able to show the available tags/groups that are currently being in used.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=list]

#End of Extract#
